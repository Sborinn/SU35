                        <h4>💧 Watering</h4>
                        <p>Check soil moisture before watering. Most plants prefer to dry out slightly between waterings. Use room temperature water and water thoroughly until it drains from the bottom.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tip-card">
                        <h4>☀️ Light Requirements</h4>
                        <p>Most houseplants prefer bright, indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight which can scorch leaves. Rotate plants weekly for even growth and consider grow lights for dark spaces.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tip-card">
                        <h4>🌡️ Temperature & Humidity</h4>
                        <p>Keep plants away from heating vents and drafts. Most tropical plants prefer temperatures between 65-75°F and higher humidity. Use a humidifier or pebble tray to increase moisture.</p>

                    <div class="tip-card">
                        <h4>🌱 Fertilizing</h4>
                        <p>Feed plants during growing season (spring/summer) with balanced liquid fertilizer. Dilute to half strength and apply monthly. Reduce or stop fertilizing in fall and winter.</p>

                    <div class="tip-card">
                        <h4>✂️ Pruning</h4>
                        <p>Remove dead, yellowing, or damaged leaves regularly. Pinch growing tips to encourage bushier growth. Clean tools with rubbing alcohol to prevent disease spread.</p>

                        <h4>🐛 Pest Prevention</h4>
                        <p>Inspect plants regularly for pests. Quarantine new plants for 2 weeks. Wipe leaves with damp cloth monthly and use insecticidal soap if needed. Good airflow helps prevent issues.</p>
